    "We started our research focusing on the intersection between pregnancy and COVID-19. Due to implications of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy remaining unclear, many pregnant women have been searching Google. Our exploration showed that from March 2020 on, information seekers increased their interest on how covid affects pregnancy. Many of the top searches as seen with the Google Trends website were of covid symptoms while pregnant, other pregnancy concerns were related to healthcare access including if it was safe to go to the hospital for delivery, home birth, and if telehealth was safe. The information from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in September 2020 states that pregnant women might be at risk for severe COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women. Specifically, “pregnant women are 5.4 times more likely to be hospitalized” (CDC, 2020). Pregnant women with COVID-19 could also be more susceptible to adverse pregnancy outcomes like preterm birth and compromised maternal health, but the relationship to COVID is unknown. In addition, the systemic reviews and case reports from PubMed searches reveal inconclusive and insufficient evidence of COVID-19 vertical transmission from mother to baby. according to research literature from June 2020 to present. In general, the literature from the pregnancy and coronavirus topic informs us of the following: common maternal complications are prematurely ruptured membranes and intrauterine distress, neonatal symptoms include shortness of breath, and no conclusive evidence supporting vertical transmission. In another literature search (utilizing PubMed and Google Scholar) investigating the topic of home deliveries and telehealth, literature reviews identified particular themes such as health care provider support for telehealth delivery, environmental attributes, and provider-patient interactions during telehealth delivery. However, most of these topics were either not accessible on the Google APIs or these tools did not allow for more in depth analysis of the pregnancy symptoms or concerns by geolocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we decided to turn our attention to babies, since healthy birth outcomes are one of the most important desired outcomes for parents-to-be. In the past, the Zika epidemic had vast psychological impacts on pregnant women due to its ability to be passed from a pregnant woman to her fetus, and now, there has been similar heightened anxiety and emotional stress during the Coronavirus pandemic as well (NBC News). Thus, we decided to explore the intersection between babies and COVID-19 since children under the age of one appear to be at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 than older children. This is due to their immature immune systems and smaller airways, making them more susceptible to develop issues with their breathing if they have respiratory infections. (Mayo Clinic) \n",
    "Currently, the known evidence COVID in babies is that those under 1 year old and children with certain underlying conditions may be more likely to have severe illness from COVID-19. According to the CDC, while most children have mild symptoms, some can get severely ill and die (CDC, 2020). The possible underlying conditions include asthma, diabetes, heart disease, and immunosuppression. According to some search data, it seems that parents’ main concerns about COVID in babies revolve around breastfeeding (Is it safe to breastfeed if mother or baby test positive?) and symptoms of rashes (possible concern is, “Are my babies rashes linked to COVID-19?”). The public health literature team did further research (literature reviews, news articles, and otherwise) to better understand these concerns. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data team made the switch to babies and coronavirus, the literature team expanded our literature search to dig deeper into popular internet searchers’ concerns on follow-up searches such as “texas babies covid”, “kawasaki disease” and its focus in New York, “toxic shock syndrome”, and the names “john travolta” and “jett travolta”. Firstly, the information we found regarding John and Jett Travolta seemed to be another irrelevant search term since John Travolta is a celebrity, and happens to have had a son who was diagnosed with Kawasaki Disease (popular search term) at a young age. Much more relevant was the “texas babies covid” search term, which upon reviewing articles and literature, revealed a situation in which 85 babies under the age of 1 tested positive for COVID-19 in Nueces County, Texas. The data confirms that 90% of children had mild symptoms, while 10% became very ill (Dong et al, 2020). Furthermore, the research on Kawasaki Disease, Toxic Shock Syndrome, and rashes symptoms in its relation to COVID-19, especially in children, is currently being investigated by the CDC. The CDC has called the condition where different organs become inflamed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). Because there have been case reports of toxic shock-like and Kawasaki-like symptoms of children going to the ER, namely New York City, we hypothesize a growing concern for children and babies with these inflammatory symptoms manifested in Google searches. The information on rashes, Kawasaki Disease, and Toxic Shock can help us interpret the main concerns and top queries a bit more.\n",

    "<b>Canada VS United States Health System</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The United States requires individuals to fund their own health care insurance with the only exception being if you qualify for a government program such as Medicare, Medicaid, or the Veterans Health Administration. Additionally, health insurance in the US is often tied to employment, with employers providing options for different insurance packages to their employees. The type of coverage varies and coverage is not guaranteed.\n",
    "In Canada, on the other hand, the federal government provides funding for health care to each provincial government as long as the province follows regulations detailed in the Canada Health Act. This funding provides all Canadian citizens with health insurance through the national health care system.\n",
    "Overall, Canada provides universal access to health care for its citizens, whereas nearly one in five non-elderly Americans is uninsured. In Canada, coverage is not tied to your job or income, everyone is in the same system, and enjoys equal access. (Materia Socio-Medica)\n",

    "<b>How the US versus Canada responded to the pandemic</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Canada and the United States are similar in many ways. With the COVID-19 outbreak, the two have similar risk profiles: similar population ages and similar distance from the earlier hotspots such as Europe and East Asia. Yet the outbreak has been dramatically worse in the United States than Canada. The United States is currently seeing around twice as many coronavirus cases as Canada and 30 percent more deaths. It’s important to note that Canada performed better during crucial moments. In the early stages of the pandemic, Canada was able to ramp up testing quickly, enabling it to better isolate the sick, trace contacts, and limit spread. Generally, this is because Canada’s single-payer national health-care system has advantages, allowing people to seek care and testing for COVID-19 without fear of out-of-pocket costs, leading to Canadian testing rates being consistently higher than the United States.  Additionally, The Canadian people have been less divided and more disciplined. Once lockdown measures were announced, they were strict, broadly uniform and widely followed, unlike the responses in the United States to lockdown measures. In Canada, there is a consensus that COVID-19 is a very serious health problem and there’s support from leaders across the political spectrum, which is different from the United States, where the Republican Party has many Coronavirus skeptic members.

Accompanied with the initial search term, it also returns the corresponding Relative Search Index, which is the search interest relative to all searches during a specific period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Health Trends API generates the Relative Search Volume for a list of top queries in a specific region and time period. Because each run of the API is a random sample, the simulation was run 30 times for the same search term, and the mean was taken across all relative search volumes in order to determine the final relative search volume for the master list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Custom Search provides us with the list of top websites that people are shown when browsing Google with the initial search term. \n",
    "\n",
    "When brainstorming what terms to use as the initial search term, it is important to keep it as generic and simple as possible so that the API may gather more data efficiently. Because we wanted to explore what concerns users’ are having when it comes to coronavirus and babies, we entered <em><b>covid babies</b></em>, <b><em>covid 19 babies</em></b>, <em><b>coronavirus babies</b></em>, and <em><b>corona babies</b></em> as initial search terms into the API. After much speculation, we came to a conclusion that they all returned similar queries, where covid babies returned queries that were more specific. Therefore, we decided to use covid babies as our initial search term, the U.S. as the geolocation, start date to be January 1, 2020, and the end date to be October 1, 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using covid babies as our initial search term, the API was run simultaneously 30 times, and the means across the relative search index and relative search volume were taken. Then, the queries that the API returns were taken as a new set of initial search terms and the process was repeated until the API yielded us no further results. After crafting a master list and gathering their corresponding relative search indices and relative search volumes, a Graph Visualization was created in order to portray user search behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "While we wanted to go into region-specific searches, the API continuously yielded us a NoneType error, meaning the data isn’t available due to privacy issues. Therefore, we decided to compare searches to our neighboring, English-speaking country, Canada. The same procedure was repeated and finally, we extracted similar top-level quieres that the U.S. and CA shared in common in order to produce a bar plot to compare how their relative search volumes differ in the two countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the Custom Search API can only yield data relevant to the U.S., so a list of popular websites was extracted and demonstrated in a bar plot as well.\n"

When looking at the interests over time for the search term “covid babies” in Canada vs the US, you can see that initially, around March, there was significantly more interest in Canada than in the US.

The public health literature team mainly used PubMed and Google Scholar in the literature search process, filtering the dates from as early as August 2019, though some articles even earlier to understand concepts and symptoms of other linked diseases.  For both the pregnancy and babies topics, we tried to include some key search terms in the search bar in order to find the most useful and relevant research articles that would inform us of the concerns that seemed to arise in the follow-up search terms generated by the data team. For search terms such as ‘texas babies and covid’ and ‘jett travolta’ we utilized Advanced Google Search to find relevant local news articles explaining the context of the searches. Most of the literature searches and articles we have looked into are from 2018, 2019, and 2020.
