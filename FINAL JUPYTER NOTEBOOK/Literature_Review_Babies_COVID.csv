Covid-19 in pregnant women and babies: What pediatricians need to know,Henry Rozycki and Sailesh Kotecha,6/13/20,What are medical considerations for mothers and babies?,Literature Review,N/A,N/A,"- Covid-19 infection in babies and infants of less than one year of age seems to be low and acquisition in most cases seems to be postnatal.
- With an altered immune system, the pregnant woman may be at risk of acquiring Covid-19 but most evidence has been based on critically ill pregnant women; although screening seems to show lesser prevalence, clearly pregnant women will continue to be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2","-viral carriage orevalence based on universal screening show that rates vary form 13% in hot spots with high cases to 3% in places with lower cases 
-vertical transmission rates are unknown but 3.1% of 311 babies born to covid-19+ moms were covid-19+ within a week of birth (26 neonates-no deaths, 1 ICU) ","-no risks for breastfeding and for milk banks are discussed 
- More data from both hospital and community-based acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 by pregnant women is required",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054220300919
COVID-19 in babies: Knowledge for neonatal care,JanetGreenaJuliaPettybPatriciaBromleycKarenWalkerdLindaJonesc,1-Oct-20,What are the paths for neonatal care for babies with coronavirus?,Literature Review,"lit review, no particular population",N/A; lit review,"-To date, emerging evidence to support vertical transmission of COVID-19 during pregnancy remains low (Knight et al., 2020). According to existing data, amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, placental tissue and breastmilk samples show low incidence (Yang et al., 2020a, 2020b). One study tested samples for SARS-CoV-2 from six newborn babies delivered to infected mothers; all samples tested negative for the virus (Lu and Shi, 2020).
-pathophysiology in babies: covid-19 directly infects ace2 receptor (expressed in organs, like lungs, & children express this less than adults do-may be a reason why children are affected less severly) ","-While babies have been infected, the naivete of the neonatal immune system in relation to the inflammatory response would appear to be protective, with further responses achieved with the consumption of human milk. The WHO has made clear recommendations about the benefits of breastfeeding, even if the mother and baby dyad is COVID-19 positive, if they remain well. The mother and baby should not be separated, and the mother needs to be able to participate in her baby's care and develop her mothering role. The complexities of not being able to access usual and adequate support means that the mother's mental health should be a priority during isolation and social distancing along with the emotional needs of the father and / or partner.
- no clear consensus on vertical transmission of the virus. Also, some case studies suggest COVID-19 in the neonate is less severe but this requires much more robust research.",,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135518412030096X
Coronavirus (COVID 19) Infection in Pregnancy,Edgar Iván Ortiz et al.,Jun-20,What are the general guidelines for managing covid infection during pregnancy? ,,N/A,N/A,"-There are no intrauterine infection confirmed cases up to now. However, recent evidence has suggested that it is probable the virus can be transmitted vertically, although the proportion of affected pregnancies and the importance for the newborn has not been determined yet 8,9. Reports of previous cases in China suggested that the was no presence of the virus in the amniotic fluid, blood of the umbilical cord, swabs of neonatal throats, placentas sabs, genital fluid, and in the samples of maternal milk of mothers infected with COVID-19 10.
-risk of intrapartum vertical tranmission or thru maternal lactation is less probable ","-others and newborn babies might be allowed to stay together as long as the use of face masks, continuing disinfection of surfaces and hand-washing procedures are guaranteed, keeping at least two-meter distance between the mother and the cradle especially after the childbirth and during the breastfeeding, either doctors have suspected the COVID-19 infection in mothers or babies (probable or confirmed)
-During the maternal lactation, the following prevention measures must be always guaranteed in order to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus during the breastfeeding or milk removal: Frequent hand-washing procedures during 40 to 60 seconds before having a physical contact with the baby or before removing milk; Use permanently standard surgical face mask (total covering of nose and mouth); avoid speaking or coughing specially during the breastfeeding or milk removal; keep the routine disinfecting measures of the areas the patient have contact with ",some findings are different from most studies i have read- they say that vertical transmission is probable and they say that the current data does not gussed higher risk of abortion or gestational loss in pregnant women which has not been the case in many other studies ,http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1657-95342020000200001

-Three newborn babies were separated from mothers right after being born and were not breastfed. ","newborn babies are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 4 were infected; 
The symptoms in newborn babies were milder and outcomes were less severe as compared to adults. 
mild or no symptoms in the youngest make it difficult to detect and prevent further transmission.
Intrauterine vertical transmission is possible but direct evidence is still lacking.; previous study of 6 pregnant women did not find any direct evidence
To vertical transmission- No mother-child contact or breastfeeding occurred in the 3 newborn babies. Time between birth and diagnosis was limited, ranging between 30 h and 5 days.

-Skin-to-skin contact and breast-feeding were not possible immediately after delivery because of postpartum maternal hemorrhage. 
-The newborn was admitted to the nursery and the result of the first RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab was inconclusive (amplification of less than 3 genes). In the nursery, the baby was fed with formula
- at 12 hrs, showed signs of feeding intolerance with abdominal distension and hyporeactivity, which rapidly worsened.
-Nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, repeated at 36 hours of life, was positive.
- increasesd lung markings (can lead to inflamation if have too many) 
-clinical condition of the baby gradually improved, a 3-day course of chloroquine was started and mechanical ventilation was stopped 36 hours after intubation.
- negative after 1 month, discharged after 18 days in good condition ","-This case confirms the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the mother to the newborn. 
-Maternal fever for 9 days, the absence of postnatal mother–baby contact, 
and the early onset of neonatal symptoms may suggest a transplacental transmission rather than birth canal infection","im asumming this was a vaginal birth and not a c section 
The major limitation in our study was that serologic tests and RT-PCR on amniotic fluid, placenta, and vaginal secretions were not performed.

This is, to our knowledge, the first case of vertical transmission of SARS-COV-2 with positive RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab at birth.
